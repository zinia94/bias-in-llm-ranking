# LLM Reranking Bias Evaluation

This repository contains the main Jupyter Notebook and its HTML export for evaluating bias in Large Language Model (LLM)–based resume reranking.  
The experiments benchmark **open-source LLMs**, **embedding models**, and **classical search methods** across:  
- Name bias  
- Order bias  
- Inconsistency  
- Anomalies  
- Mitigation strategies  

## Files
- **`notebook.ipynb`** – Full code and experiments (runnable on Google Colab T4 GPU). Contains the synthetic dataset used in all tests.  
- **`notebook.html`** – Static HTML export for quick viewing without execution.  

## Notes
- All data is synthetic and included directly in the notebook.  
- No proprietary model results are included.  
- Repository is anonymized for review.

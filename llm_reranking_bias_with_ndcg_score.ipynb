        "This section evaluates **embedding-based rerankers** for potential bias in candidate ranking.  \n",

        "### Embedding Models Used\n",
        "The following embedding models were evaluated:\n",
        "1. **MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** – Lightweight, fast embedding model suitable for semantic search.\n",
        "2. **MPNet (all-mpnet-base-v2)** – Optimized for sentence-level semantic similarity tasks.\n",
        "3. **E5-large** – High-performance embedding model for dense retrieval.\n",
        "4. **GTE-large** – Embedding model trained for high-quality multilingual semantic search.\n",
        "5. **GTE-large-en-v1.5** – English-optimized variant of GTE-large.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generic Utility Functions\n",
        "1. **`print_ranked_candidates`**  \n",
        "   - Displays model-ranked candidates along with their CV strength (Strong/Weak).  \n",
        "   - Helps visually inspect the ranking for possible bias patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`rank_candidates_by_embedding`**  \n",
        "   - Core ranking function for embedding models.  \n",
        "   - Inputs:  \n",
        "     - `model_name` – Name of the embedding model.  \n",
        "     - `job_description` – Fixed job posting used for all runs.  \n",
        "     - `resumes` – Candidate CVs for the specific experiment setup.  \n",
        "   - Generates embeddings, computes similarity scores, and returns the ranked list.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`bias_detection_in_embeddings`**  \n",
        "   - The **bias testing framework** for embedding models.  \n",
        "   - Inputs:  \n",
        "     - `embedding_model_name` – The model to be tested.  \n",
        "   - Runs **six experiments** using `rank_candidates_by_embedding`:\n",
        "     1. **Name Bias (Run 1)** – Weak CVs: Names List 1, Strong CVs: Names List 2.\n",
        "     2. **Name Bias (Run 2)** – Weak CVs: Names List 2, Strong CVs: Names List 1.\n",
        "     3. **Order Bias** – Same CVs as Name Bias (Run 1) but with candidate order reversed.\n",
        "     4. **Consistency Check** – Repeat of Name Bias (Run 1) to test reproducibility.\n",
        "     5. **Mitigation – Neutral Labels** – Weak CVs: `Candidate 1–10`, Strong CVs: `Person A–J`.\n",

        "This section evaluates **classical ranking methods** for potential bias in candidate ranking.  \n",
        "Instead of embeddings or LLMs, these methods use traditional information retrieval algorithms to score and rank candidates.\n",

        "### Classical Methods Used\n",
        "1. **BM25 (rank_candidate_bm25)**  \n",
        "   - Uses the BM25 ranking algorithm from `rank_bm25`.  \n",
        "   - Scores each candidate CV based on keyword match relevance to the job description.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity (rank_candidate_tf_idf)**  \n",
        "   - Uses TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity to compare candidate CVs to the job description.  \n",
        "   - Scores are based on term frequency weighted by inverse document frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Framework Function\n",
        "- **`bias_detection_in_classical_models`**  \n",
        "  - Generic bias testing framework for classical ranking methods.\n",
        "  - Inputs:\n",
        "    - A ranking function (either `rank_candidate_bm25` or `rank_candidate_tf_idf`).\n",
        "  - Runs the same six experiments as in the embedding and LLM sections:\n",
        "    1. **Name Bias (Run 1)** – Weak CVs: Names List 1, Strong CVs: Names List 2.\n",
        "    2. **Name Bias (Run 2)** – Weak CVs: Names List 2, Strong CVs: Names List 1.\n",
        "    3. **Order Bias** – Same CVs as Name Bias (Run 1) but with candidate order reversed.\n",
        "    4. **Consistency Check** – Repeat of Name Bias (Run 1) to test reproducibility.\n",
        "    5. **Mitigation – Neutral Labels** – Weak CVs: `Candidate 1–10`, Strong CVs: `Person A–J`.\n",
        "    6. **Mitigation – Uniform Token** – All names replaced with the same token: `name`.\n",
